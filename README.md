# 🚀 Overview

LogiBridge is a **production-grade delivery integration platform** that connects:

* 🏢 Companies → create and track delivery orders
* 🚚 Delivery companies → accept and process orders
* 🛡️ Admin → monitor and control system

> Designed using real-world backend engineering practices: security, scalability, and clean architecture.

# 🧠 Architecture

```text
Controller → Service → Repository → Entity
```

### Core Principles:

* JWT → Authentication (WHO)
* DB → Authorization (WHAT)
* Entity → Business Logic (HOW)

---

# 🏗️ Project Structure

# 🔐 Authentication & Security

### ✔ Features:

* JWT Authentication (stateless)
* Refresh Token Rotation (stored in DB)
* RBAC (database-driven roles)
* BCrypt password hashing
* Token type validation (ACCESS vs REFRESH)
* Centralized exception handling

---

# 🛡️ Advanced Security

## 🔥 Audit Logging

Tracks all critical actions:

* AUTH_SUCCESS / AUTH_FAILED
* ORDER_CREATED / UPDATED / CANCELLED
* DELIVERY_ACCEPT / REJECT
* ADMIN_FORCE_STATUS

Example:

```
[AUDIT] action=ORDER_ACCEPTED userId=5 role=ROLE_DELIVERY
```

---

## 🔥 Rate Limiting (Anti-Brute Force)

* Max 5 failed attempts per IP
* 5-minute window
* Returns HTTP 429 when exceeded
* Thread-safe implementation (ConcurrentHashMap)

---

## 🔥 Secure JWT Design

* No roles inside JWT
* Roles always loaded from DB
* Prevents privilege escalation

---

# 📦 Order & Tracking System

## 🔄 Order Lifecycle

```text
PENDING → ASSIGNED → ACCEPTED → IN_PROGRESS → DELIVERED
↘
REJECTED / CANCELLED
```

---

## 🧠 Domain-Driven Design

Business logic inside entity:

```java
order.accept();
order.reject();
order.markDelivered();
```

✔ Prevents invalid transitions  
✔ Keeps logic centralized

---

## 📊 Tracking System (Audit Trail)

Every state change creates a tracking record:

* previous_status
* new_status
* changed_by
* timestamp
* location

---

# ⚙️ Core Services

## OrderService

Handles:

* Create Order
* Accept / Reject
* Update Status
* Cancel Order
* Admin Force Update

✔ Includes validation + concurrency handling + audit logging

---

## OrderQueryService

* Filtering
* Company orders
* Delivery orders

✔ Uses Specification pattern

---

## OrderAssignmentService

* Assigns delivery users randomly (MVP)
* Based on ROLE_DELIVERY users

---

# 👨‍💼 Admin Module

### Features:

* Filter all orders
* Force order status

### Rules:

Admin can force only:

* IN_PROGRESS
* DELIVERED
* CANCELLED

---

# 🛡️ Validation Layer

OrderValidator:

* validateOwnership
* validateDeliveryAccess
* validateTransition

---

# ⚡ Concurrency Handling

* Uses Optimistic Locking (@Version)
* Prevents race conditions

---

# 🚀 How to Run

````markdown
# 🐳 Docker Setup

Run the entire system (Backend + Database) using Docker.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- Docker Desktop installed

---

## 🚀 Run the project

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## 🌐 Access the application

* API:
  http://localhost:8080

* Swagger UI:
  http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

---

## 🧱 Services

| Service  | Description         |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| app      | Spring Boot backend |
| postgres | PostgreSQL database |

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Configured inside `docker-compose.yml`:

* SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL
* SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME
* SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD
* AUTH_JWT_SECRET

---

## 📝 Notes

* First build may take a few minutes
* Subsequent runs are faster
* Uses PostgreSQL inside container
